          <p><img src="img/whitey.jpeg" alt="A white moose in a forest">You're probably wondering why I have a picture of albino mooses everywhere! At least, I hope so. You see, I was raised in native villages along the Yukon river in western Alaska, and being the only "Gussuc"(white boy). I was an easy target for malicious nicknames. <em>Dzisk'w Dlèit</em> was my first, as I was small, white and weak. <em>Dzisk'w Dlèit</em> translates roughly to "white moose" and is a malicious insult as not only are albino moose rare, but they suffer from afflictionss that make it even rarer for them to reach adulthood. They have compromised immune systems, a sensitivity to light and a complete lack of camoflage. "But Luke," You might ask, "Alaska is super snowy, right? Wouldn't they blend in with the snow?". You would be right! But considering that half the year Alaska is lush and verdant with vegetation, they are completely exposed in the summer months, when predators run rampant, uninhibited by deep snow. Anyway, it was a nasty name and meant as an insult. But I learned to own it, and as I grew up I found I liked it. Anyhow, I moved here eight years ago to live in a warmer climate with more civilization, and I found it! Since then I've been working as a landscaper in the summer bartending and odd jobs in the off season. Then I discovered how awesome coding is, and now I'm here at Epicodus making web pages and writing to you. Life is good! Thanks for reading!
